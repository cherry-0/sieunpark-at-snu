        <p>My ongoing work spans three application domains:</p>
        <p><strong>Privacy-Aware Collaboration in Virtual Environments </strong></p>
        <p>– PRISM, an intelligent object-sharing system for collaborative VR, dynamically adjusts shared object visibility based on user roles, proximity, and interaction context to balance privacy and usability. </p>
        <p><strong>In-Situ Adaptive Assistance</strong></p>
        <p>– TaleTrain, a real-time scaffolding system that interprets children’s utterances during storytelling and guides caregivers with graduated prompts</p>
        <p>– CRAFT, a mixed reality system that provides situated guidance for interacting with complex physical objects based on the user’s environment and object state.</p>
        <p><strong>LLM-Powered Task Assistance</strong></p>
        <p>– Lumo, a system that enables language-based interaction with mobile apps. It leverages LLMs and in-context demonstrations to incrementally improve inference quality and personalize the experience to the user’s intent.</p>

        <p>Across these efforts, I aim to create human-aligned AI systems that enhance learning, agency, and trust in everyday technologies.</p>
        <p>I’m always happy to connect with others interested in similar visions!</p>

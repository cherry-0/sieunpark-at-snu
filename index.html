        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a first-year PhD candidate in the Interdisciplinary Program in Artificial Intelligence at Seoul National University (SNU), advised by <a href="https://youngkilee.blogspot.com/p/about-me.html">Prof. Youngki Lee</a> in the <a href="https://hcs.snu.ac.kr/">Human-Centered Computer Systems Lab</a>.</p>
        <p>My research explores how large language models and mixed reality interfaces can be integrated to build usable, adaptive, and socially grounded systems. I focus on contexts where sharing privacy-sensitive informationâ€”when done appropriatelyâ€”can significantly enhance collaboration, learning, and interaction through mixed reality.</p>
        <p>Currently, I design situated support systems for real-world tasks such as early education and collaborative mixed reality environments. These systems combine multimodal sensing, natural language understanding, and task-aware interaction modeling to adapt in real time to user input, task progress, and social context. A core aspect of my work involves developing graduated assistance strategies that provide timely, context-sensitive support while maintaining fine-grained control over what information is shared. This research contributes to advancing human-centered AI by addressing the practical and social challenges of building intelligent systems in sensitive, high-impact domains.</p>
